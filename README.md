## OVERVIEW

This exploratory analysis aims to assist PyBer in improving access to rideshare services, and determining affordability for underserved areas by identifying trends in ridership and fare data. 

The data provided categorized each service region by type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). Each type was then analyzed based on the following criteria:

* The total rides (%)
* The total drivers (%)
* The total fares (%)
* The average fare per ride and driver
* The total fare by city type
